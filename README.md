# SugoiClippy
Play Twitch Clips on demand
## Features
- Consent: Clippy requires that the user who receives a shoutout gives their consent before playing their clips.
- Featured Clips: By default, Clippy will prefer to use only featured clips, so you don't end up with random garbage or accidental clips on stream.
- Full Control: You decide how clips are selected via a drag&drop filter menu, offering the most control of any clip player.
- Full Customization: You can add fonts, CSS, JS modules, or even full HTML documents to your config to customize Clippy to your brand.
